# HYPE/USDC DNMM Reports Guide

**Path**: `hype-usdc-dnmm/reports`

**Description**: Generated artifacts (gas, metrics, CI, security) that track DNMM performance, quality gates, and audit status.

## Purpose
- Capture the structure and intent of reports generated by CI, gas benchmarking, invariants, and security tooling.
- Provide maintainers with guidance on consuming and updating report artifacts alongside code changes.

## Quick Start
- Review `gas/gas_report.json` and `gas-snapshots.txt` after performance-affecting commits; update docs if budgets shift.
- Consume CI quality gates from `ci/` before merging substantial protocol changes.
- Keep `DNMM_L3_*` indexes in sync with documentation deliverables when adding features.

## Coding Standards
- Reports are data files; ensure JSON remains minified or prettified consistently (`jq -S`).
- Prefer machine-readable formats (JSON/CSV) for new artifacts; accompany narrative summaries with Markdown when necessary.
- When regenerating reports, document the command and environment in commit messages or release notes.

## Testing Expectations
- Re-run relevant test suites (`forge test`, `script/run_invariants.sh`, shadow-bot drills) before refreshing reports.
- Validate gas deltas via `forge test --gas-report` and update `reports/gas/gas_report.json` accordingly.
- Ensure CI summaries (`ci/quality_gates_summary.json`) stay green before shipping releases.

## Operational Notes
- Archive snapshot files per release to preserve audit trails; do not delete historical entries without product approval.
- Reference `docs/GAS_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` and `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` when interpreting report deltas.
- Track open report gaps (missing metrics, stale gas baselines) and file follow-up tasks.

## Maintainers & Contacts
- Primary: TBD (assign owner)
- Backup: TBD (assign delegate)
- Pager/Alert Routing: See `docs/OPERATIONS.md`

## Change Log
- 2025-10-03: Added gas report delta notes for AOMQ/preview enablement and documented new docs indexes.
