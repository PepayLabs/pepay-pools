# Notebook Workspace

Use this directory for exploratory analyses (e.g., curve fitting, oracle latency histograms, backtest diagnostics). Prefer lightweight `.ipynb` or `.qmd` files that reference datasets from `../data/` to maintain reproducibility. Document assumptions and outputs in the corresponding deliverable under `../docs/`.
