- contracts/lib/FeePolicy.sol: consolidate `FeeConfig` fields (base/cap/decay/alpha/beta) into a packed `uint256` and unpack into stack locals in `preview/settle` to reduce SLOADs on hot paths.
- contracts/DnmPool.sol: reuse cached fee/inventory configs across `_readOracle` and `_quoteInternal` to avoid re-decoding when multiple swaps occur within the same transaction batch (consider short-lived memory cache if profiler shows benefit).
- script/run_invariants.sh: parallel shards currently echo full forge logs; piping through `--gas-report` during smoke runs can surface regressions early without re-running the full perf suite.
