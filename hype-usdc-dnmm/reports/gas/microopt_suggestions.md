- ✅ contracts/lib/FeePolicy.sol: `FeeConfig` now packs to a single word with a cached decay multiplier; hot paths decode once per call.
- ✅ contracts/DnmPool.sol: fee/inventory configs reuse packed storage and immutable token metadata to trim SLOADs.
- contracts/lib/Inventory.sol: investigate precomputing floor reserves for common sizes or caching deviation inputs when quote + swap occur in the same block to shave a few hundred gas more from stretch targets.
- script/run_invariants.sh: parallel shards currently echo full forge logs; piping through `--gas-report` during smoke runs can surface regressions early without re-running the full perf suite.
